# Income Management: Edit & Delete Features

## ‚úÖ What Was Added

Added full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for **Management Funds** and **Sponsors**.

## üÜï New Views Added

### Management Fund Views (`views.py`)

1. **`edit_management_fund(request, pk)`**
   - Permission required: `tedx_finance.change_managementfund`
   - Allows treasurers to edit existing management fund entries
   - Uses the same form template as add with updated title/button

2. **`delete_management_fund(request, pk)`**
   - Permission required: `tedx_finance.delete_managementfund`
   - POST-only endpoint to delete management fund entries
   - Shows confirmation message with deleted amount

### Sponsor Views (`views.py`)

1. **`edit_sponsor(request, pk)`**
   - Permission required: `tedx_finance.change_sponsor`
   - Allows treasurers to edit existing sponsor information
   - Supports file uploads (agreement documents)

2. **`delete_sponsor(request, pk)`**
   - Permission required: `tedx_finance.delete_sponsor`
   - POST-only endpoint to delete sponsor entries
   - Shows confirmation message with sponsor name

## üîó New URL Patterns (`urls.py`)

```python
# Management Funds
path('fund/<int:pk>/edit/', views.edit_management_fund, name='edit_management_fund')
path('fund/<int:pk>/delete/', views.delete_management_fund, name='delete_management_fund')

# Sponsors
path('sponsor/<int:pk>/edit/', views.edit_sponsor, name='edit_sponsor')
path('sponsor/<int:pk>/delete/', views.delete_sponsor, name='delete_sponsor')
```

## üé® Dashboard Updates (`dashboard.html`)

### Sponsors Section
- **Updated data source**: Now uses `sponsors_list` (full Sponsor objects) instead of `sponsors_with_tiers`
- **Added Edit button**: Blue pencil icon that links to edit form
- **Added Delete button**: Red trash icon with confirmation dialog
- **Shows date received**: Displays when sponsor contribution was received
- **Treasurer-only actions**: Edit/delete buttons only visible to treasurers

### Management Funds Section (NEW!)
- **New section**: Displays all management fund entries
- **Visual design**: Green gradient matching the income theme
- **Shows amount & date**: Each fund entry displays amount and date received
- **Edit button**: Links to edit form for each fund entry
- **Delete button**: Confirmation dialog before deletion
- **Scrollable list**: Max height with custom scrollbar for many entries

## üîí Permissions

All edit and delete operations require:
- User must be logged in
- User must have appropriate Django permissions:
  - `change_managementfund` / `delete_managementfund`
  - `change_sponsor` / `delete_sponsor`
- Typically granted to the "Treasurer" group

## üí° User Experience

### Edit Flow
1. User clicks **Edit** icon (pencil) on a sponsor or fund
2. Redirects to same form used for adding (pre-filled with existing data)
3. Form title changes to "Edit Sponsor: [Name]" or "Edit Management Fund: ‚Çπ[Amount]"
4. Button text changes to "Update Sponsor" or "Update Fund"
5. On success, redirects to dashboard with success message

### Delete Flow
1. User clicks **Delete** icon (trash) on a sponsor or fund
2. JavaScript confirmation dialog appears:
   - Sponsors: "Are you sure you want to delete sponsor '[Name]'?"
   - Funds: "Are you sure you want to delete the management fund of ‚Çπ[Amount]?"
3. If confirmed, creates and submits hidden POST form with CSRF token
4. Backend deletes record and redirects with warning message

## üéØ Features Preserved

- ‚úÖ All existing functionality maintained
- ‚úÖ Audit trail via `simple-history` package
- ‚úÖ Date filtering still works
- ‚úÖ Dashboard calculations unaffected
- ‚úÖ Light/dark theme support
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive design
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling

## üîç Technical Details

### Context Updates
Dashboard view now passes additional context:
```python
'management_funds_list': mf_qs.order_by('-date_received')
'sponsors_list': sp_qs.order_by('-date_received')
```

### JavaScript Functions
- `deleteSponsor(id, name)` - Handles sponsor deletion with confirmation
- `deleteManagementFund(id, amount)` - Handles fund deletion with confirmation
- `getCookie(name)` - Retrieves CSRF token for POST requests

### Form Reuse
Both edit views reuse existing form templates:
- `tedx_finance/add_management_fund.html`
- `tedx_finance/add_sponsor.html`

Context variables control the display:
- `form_title` - Changes based on add/edit mode
- `form_button` - Changes text to "Save" or "Update"

## üì± Mobile Support

All new features fully responsive:
- Edit/delete buttons properly sized on mobile
- Confirmation dialogs work on all devices
- Touch-friendly button spacing
- Lists scroll smoothly on small screens

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Add inline editing (edit-in-place without redirect)
- [ ] Add bulk delete for sponsors/funds
- [ ] Add sponsor categories/tags
- [ ] Add fund allocation tracking
- [ ] Export sponsors to Excel
- [ ] Add sponsor contact management interface
